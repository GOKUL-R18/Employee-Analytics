## **Objective:**

The goal of this project is to build an interactive Employee Analytics dashboard that analyzes employee attendance data, provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), and identifies trends and areas for improvement using Power BI. The dashboard empowers HR teams to track attendance patterns effectively.

## **Tech Stacks and Tools Learned:**

- **Power BI**: Used for designing, developing, and visualizing the HR dashboard.
- **Power Query**: For cleaning, transforming, and preparing data before analysis.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used for writing queries, creating calculated columns, measures, and KPIs.
- **Data Modeling**: For structuring data relationships to ensure accurate analysis and reporting.

## **Actions Taken:**

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation Using Power Query:**
   - Connected to employee attendance data using Power Query.
   - Cleaned and transformed data by removing duplicates, renaming columns, and changing data types.
   - Encapsulated transformation steps into reusable functions for easy application to new datasets.
   - Created parameters for selecting specific conditions, enabling more dynamic data filtering.

### 2. **Data Exploration and Manipulation Using DAX Query:**
   - Employed DAX functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `CALCULATE`, `IF`, `SWITCH`, `DIVIDE`, and date-time functions.
   - Created calculated columns and measures to extract meaningful insights from the data.
   - Analyzed KPIs like average attendance, absenteeism rates, and employee performance.

### 3. **Power BI Dashboard Design and Visualization:**
   - Designed the dashboard layout with a clear and intuitive structure.
   - Added slicers, measures, and filters to enhance interactivity.
   - Implemented a variety of visualizations such as card charts, pie charts, line charts, matrix charts, and area charts.
   - Added key HR metrics (e.g., absenteeism, total attendance, trends) to improve decision-making capabilities.
   - Incorporated slicers for dynamic filtering by month and department.

## **Result:**

- Successfully created an interactive HR dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of employee attendance data.
- This Dashboard can save 3 to 4 hours of work for HR team daily
- The dashboard allows HR teams to quickly analyze attendance trends, detect absenteeism issues, and make data-driven decisions to improve workforce management.
- The use of DAX queries and Power Query transformations optimized the dashboard's performance and ensured accurate KPI reporting.
- The visualizations, including cards, pie charts, and line graphs, enhanced the user experience and provided valuable insights into attendance patterns over time.

This project demonstrates the power of data transformation, modeling, and visualization in Employee Analytics, enabling actionable insights and effective decision-making.
